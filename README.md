## üéØ Overview

‚ö†Ô∏è **WORK IN PROGRESS** - This backtesting engine is actively under development. Current implementation shows promising but overly selective results.

This project demonstrates the evolution from single-indicator strategies to sophisticated multi-indicator consensus systems. Built from scratch using pure Python and NumPy, it provides a realistic backtesting environment that accounts for actual trading costs and market friction.

### üöÄ What Makes This Different

- **Commission-First Approach**: All strategies tested with realistic 0.2% total commission
- **Memory-Efficient Design**: Custom sliding window cache for processing large datasets
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure Python implementation (NumPy only)
- **Research-Backed Combinations**: Indicator selection based on academic studies

## üìä Strategy Results

### Single Indicator Performance

| Strategy | Trades | Win Rate | Net P&L (1 lot) | Dataset Size | Status |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| RSI Alone | 887 | 29.99% | -$175,410 | 100k candles | ‚ùå Unprofitable |
| SMA Crossover | 4,077 | 7.68% | -$894,580 | 100k candles | ‚ùå Too noisy |

### Combined Indicator Performance

| Strategy | Trades | Win Rate | Net P&L (1 lot) | Dataset Size | Status |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| RSI + SMA | 3 | 66.67% | +$1,282 | 100k candles | ‚ö†Ô∏è Too selective |

### üöß Current Challenge

**The Problem**: Current RSI + SMA combination is extremely selective, generating only **3 trades from 100,000 candles** (0.003% activity rate).

**Target Goal**: Achieve approximately **500 trades** from the same dataset while maintaining profitable performance.

**Solution in Development**: Adding complementary indicators to increase trade frequency without sacrificing signal quality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Components

```python
# Custom cache system for efficient data processing
class Cache:
    - Sliding window data management
    - Memory-efficient price storage
    - Real-time data streaming simulation

# Wilder's EMA implementation for RSI calculation
class EMACalc:
    - Exponential moving average with proper alpha
    - Stateful calculation for streaming data
    - Optimized for RSI smoothing

# SMA crossover detection
class SMACrossOver:
    - Fast/slow moving average comparison
    - Crossover signal generation
    - Historical state tracking
```

### Key Features

- **üéØ Precision-First Design**: Quality over quantity approach to trade selection
- **‚ö° Real-Time Processing**: Streaming data simulation with efficient cache management
- **üî¨ Research Integration**: Indicator combinations based on empirical studies
- **üí∞ Realistic Modeling**: Comprehensive cost analysis including spreads and commissions

## üìã Requirements

```
Python 3.7+
NumPy
CSV data file (EURUSD_M15.csv)
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forex-backtesting-engine
cd forex-backtesting-engine
```

2. **Prepare your data**
```
Place your EURUSD_M15.csv file in the project directory
CSV format: Date Time, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
```

3. **Run the backtest**
```bash
python main.py
```

4. **Configure parameters** (interactive prompts)
```
RSI Overbought level (default: 70)
RSI Oversold level (default: 30)
RSI Window (default: 14)
Fast SMA Window (default: 7)
```

## üìà Strategy Logic

### Current Implementation
- **Entry Condition**: RSI signal + SMA crossover agreement
- **Risk Management**: Fixed take profit (+10 pips) and stop loss (-5 pips)
- **Position Sizing**: 1 standard lot (100,000 units)
- **Signal Weighting**: RSI (100%), SMA (0%) - *configurable*

### Planned Enhancements (In Development)
- **MACD Histogram**: Trend acceleration confirmation - *increases trade frequency*
- **ADX Filter**: Trend strength validation - *reduces false signals in ranging markets*
- **Williams %R**: Additional momentum confirmation - *improves entry timing*
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Risk-based lot calculation

## üî¨ Research Foundation

This implementation is guided by empirical research showing:

- **Combined indicators outperform single indicators** by 15-30% in win rate
- **MACD + RSI combinations** achieve 50-73% win rates in trending markets
- **ADX filtering** reduces false signals by up to 40%
- **Commission impact** can turn profitable strategies unprofitable (demonstrated in our RSI results)

## üìä Sample Output

```
=== BACKTEST SUMMARY ===
Total Trades: 3
Winning Trades: 2
Losing Trades: 1
Average Win: 0.01500
Average Loss: 0.00800
Winrate: 66.67%
Net PnL assuming trading 1 lot: +$1,282.00
```
